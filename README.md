# MATH_number_digits_in_pi
A series of programs to examine whether a number or a digit combination exists in pi

_Created after reading Chapter 10 of "Python Crash Course"_
* The text file contains the first 1 million digits of pi
* Repo contains three programs and one module (__functions_for_pi.py__). 
* __digitsCombinationsInPi.py__ checks the existence of all digit combinations (with the number of digits given by user) in the first 1 million digits of pi.
* __givenNumberInPi.py__ checks the existence of a user-input number in the first 1 million digits of pi.
* __numbersInPi.py__ checks the existence of all natural numbers (zero included) with the given number of digits in the first 1 million digits of pi.
